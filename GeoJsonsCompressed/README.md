Country: GeoJsons by Country
Admin1: GeoJson by Admin1 (Largest subregions by Country. ie. States for US; Prefectures for Japan)

Files are organized as follows:
- Country
  - All Countries
  - By Region
- Admin1
  - All Countries
  - By Country
  - By Region/Subregion

Hoping to add Postal Codes but am having trouble finding GeoJsons for Postal Codes in all Countries.
Let me know you find this and I will add it to this repository!
