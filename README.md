# World GeoJsons

I was having some trouble finding easy ways to get GeoJsons by Country and Admin1

Country being GeoJsons by Country
Admin1 being GeoJson by Admin1 (Largest subregions by Country. ie. States for US; Prefectures for Japan)

Files are organized as follows:
- GeoJson
  - Country
    - All Countries
    - By Region
  - Admin1
    - All Countries
    - By Country
    - By Region/Subregion
