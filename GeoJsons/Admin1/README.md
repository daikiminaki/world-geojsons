# GeoJsons by Admin1

I was having some trouble finding easy ways to get GeoJsons by Country and Admin1

Admin1: GeoJson by Admin1 (Largest subregions by Country. ie. States for US; Prefectures for Japan)

Files are organized as follows:
### Admin1
- All Countries
- By Country
- By Region/Subregion

Hoping to add Postal Codes but am having trouble finding GeoJsons for Postal Codes in all Countries.
Let me know you find this and I will add it to this repository!
